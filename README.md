# Pet Listing Web Application

This is a simple pet listing web application built using React. The application allows users to view a list of pets, see details of each pet, and search for specific pets.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the app, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Dependencies

This project relies on several key dependencies:

- **json-server**: Used to mock a REST API for our application.
- **concurrently**: Allows us to run multiple commands concurrently.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables routing capabilities within our React app.
- **axios**: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.

To install these dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install json-server concurrently react-router-dom axios


## Starting the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will run both the frontend and the mock backend concurrently.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic React Components**: Create reusable and dynamic components to display pet information.
- **State Management**: Manage the application state using `useState` and handle side effects with `useEffect`.
- **Routing**: Set up routes to navigate between different pages using `react-router-dom`.
- **API Calls**: Make asynchronous requests to the mock API using `axios`.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the frontend and mock backend concurrently.

## API Mocking with json-server

This project uses `json-server` to mock a REST API. The data is stored in `db.json`. You can modify this file to add or update pet data. The mock API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/pets`.
